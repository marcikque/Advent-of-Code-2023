# Advent of Code 2023


## These are my solutions for 'Advent of Code 2023'

My choice of language fell on 'Python'.
Despite my experience with libraries such as 'Pandas', 'Numpy', and 'Torch', I have never dived deep into the basics.
To fill this gap, I dedicate this year's 25 puzzles to get more comfortable with the language as a whole.

### Constraints
My approach is simple:
- 'no hardcoding': all of my code should be able to run without the need to insert values from the input.
- 'no preparsing': despite simplifying things, changing the input just doesn't feel right.
- 'no custom utils import': I want to code as much as possible and repeat the basics time after time. Elaborated utils packages would hinder me from that.


## Motivation
I am really excited for this year's coding puzzles and cannot wait to dive into all of them.
Additionally, by joining multiple private leaderboards, I have a lot of motivation to not fall back and solve every single day.
